These are the resources used: 
pytest : https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/testing/ and https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/how-to/index.html 
dex: TAs helped with the code for routing it 
Frontend : 
1. Code from hw 2
2. greeksforgreek website for help with css for the side bar 
3. svelte docs for understanding components for creating the sidebar component
4. Chatgpt:
    a. was used for debugging whenever there would be random errors 
    b. helped with the overlay inside the sidebar component, learnt more about z-index and how it worked and help with the css for overlay
    c. learnt how I can export variables so the app.svelte can send the sidebar component the variables 
    d. learnt about bind 
 
Backend:
1. For GET used prof code from lecture about flask + mongo 
2. Chatgpt: 
    a. help me understand more about the comments inside the mongo compass database and now to create different elements 
    b. random debugging when the comments won't apper and needed to add unique id which I did myself 


Overall Interms of AI usage: 
We mostly used it for debugging and to understand the errors we were getting BECAUSE we didn't learn about this. A lot of it was struggling with 
understanding the structure of mongodb compass and also the backend which was only brifely taught to us. 


Extra: 
In terms of the pytests they are all very basic because no one went over how to actually make the tests with pytests.
I tried to test more advanced stuff like if the routing worked HOWEVER the dockerfile won't allow for the connection with the pytest file
created and with the mongodb connection, so I was unable to test more advanced test cases.
